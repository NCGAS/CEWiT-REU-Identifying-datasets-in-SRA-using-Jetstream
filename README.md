# CEWiT-REU-Identifying-datasets-in-SRA-using-Jetstream

This project was done by National Center for Genome Analysis Support ([NCGAS](https://ncgas.org/)), and two undergraduate studnets, Haley Leffeler, and Sruthi Ganapaneni who worked with us for a year as part of the Center of Exceller for Women in Tech ([CEWiT(http://cewit.indiana.edu/)) [REU program](http://cewit.indiana.edu/students/REU/index.shtml). Over the last  year the students focused on developing a workflow to search Sequence Read Arhive ([SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)) to identify datasets that contain a sequence/genome of interest. This project is also in collaboration with [Rob Edward's lab](https://edwards.sdsu.edu) from [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/) who have previosuly developed a gateway to [search SRA](https://www.searchsra.org/) that is aavailable to the community.
