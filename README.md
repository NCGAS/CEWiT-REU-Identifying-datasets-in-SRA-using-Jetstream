# CEWiT-REU-Identifying-datasets-in-SRA-using-Jetstream

This project was done by National Center for Genome Analysis Support ([NCGAS](https://ncgas.org/)), and two undergraduate studnets, Haley Leffeler, and Sruthi Ganapaneni who worked with us for a year as part of the Center of Exceller for Women in Tech ([CEWiT](http://cewit.indiana.edu/)) [REU program](http://cewit.indiana.edu/students/REU/index.shtml). Over the last  year the students focused on developing a workflow to search Sequence Read Arhive ([SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra)) to identify datasets that contain a sequence/genome of interest. This project is also in collaboration with [Rob Edward's lab](https://edwards.sdsu.edu) from [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/) who have previously developed a gateway to [search SRA](https://www.searchsra.org/) that is available to the community. 

#### Main objective of the project 
The objective of this project was to develop a workflow to search SRA datasets using the developed gateway SearchSRA to identify datasets that contain the sequence of interest. The workflow focused on filtering the results from searchSRA to filter and visualize the results to confirm the presence of the sequence. The resulting datasets that do contain the sequence of interest can now be added to the research project for analysis as needed. 

#### Common steps included in the workflow
